Project Topic: House Price Prediction using Machine learning and Image Processing

Dataset: [House Prices and Images - SoCal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal)

### [SVM, RFR, LR Models](https://github.com/malleedi/COMP562FinalProject/blob/main/SVM-RFR-LR-Models_without_Image_Processing.ipynb)
By using numerical data such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc. we were able to train three models: SVM, Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression. Of these models, the Random Forest Regression model proved to be the best at predicting House Prices in Southern California with an error rate of approximately 5%.

### [Decision Tree Model](https://github.com/malleedi/COMP562FinalProject/blob/main/decision-tree-model.ipynb)
By using numerical data such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, we trained a DT regression model to predict if a house was worth 1 million dollars or more and a Decison Tree (DT) model to predict house prices based on numerical data. The DT model returned an accuracy score of about 89.66% with about a 28% average rate of error. 

### [Linear Regression with Location](https://github.com/malleedi/COMP562FinalProject/blob/main/LR_with_Geopy_Point_Data.ipynb)
By using numerical data and GeoPy location point data of houses, we trained a Linear Regression model. The model resulted in an error rate of approximately 37%.
