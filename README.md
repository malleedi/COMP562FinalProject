Project Topic: House Price Prediction using Machine learning and Image Processing

Dataset: [House Prices and Images - SoCal](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal)

### [SVM, RFR, LR Models without Image Processing](https://github.com/malleedi/COMP562FinalProject/blob/main/SVM-RFR-LR-Models_without_Image_Processing.ipynb)
By using numerical data such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc. we were able to train three models: SVM, Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression. Of these models, the Random Forest Regression model proved to be the best at predicting House Prices in Southern California with an error rate of approximately 5%.

### [Decision Tree Model](https://github.com/malleedi/COMP562FinalProject/blob/main/decision-tree-model.ipynb)
By using numerical data such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, we trained a Decison Tree (DT) model (and DT regression model) to predict if a house was worth 1 million dollars or more. The DT model returned an accuracy score of about 89.66% with about a 28% average rate of error.
